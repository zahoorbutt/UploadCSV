# UploadCSV
This web based project was created in c# .net 4.5x using MVC 5, EFW 6 and SQL Server as DB
This project accepts CSV files only 
This will save the uploaded file as is and save data in a table in SQL DB attached in the project
I'm proud to have this done using MVC framework. 

Let me know your thoughts @ zahoor_butt@hotmail.com
